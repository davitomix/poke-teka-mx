    <p> This application was built with business specifications. Some of them are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manage calls with API, in this case, calls are made dynamically based on the user&apos;s position.</li>
      <li>The data that was retrieved from the API should be stored in the Redux store.</li>
      <li>Integrate the functionality of filtering the elements by category.</li>
      <li>Implement the feature of filtering the elements by text written by the user.</li>
      <li>Every page, the main page and pages for each item, should have a unique route within the SPA.</li>
      <li>App tested with Enzyme.</li>
      <li>The use of react hooks and functional components was prioritized over class components.</li>
    </ul>
